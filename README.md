**Unity Developer Internship Trial - Runic Dices Entertainment**

 <br>
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

This repository contains the **Unity Developer Internship Trial** for **Runic Dices Entertainment**. The tasks in this trial assess my skills in Unity development, GitHub workflow, AI state machines, and core gameplay systems.

I aim to complete all tasks within the **5-day timeframe** while maintaining clean code, best practices, and efficient workflow management.


## Trial Tasks

### Task 1: Unity Project Setup & GitHub Integration

**Goal**: Set up a Unity project with version control in GitHub.

- Initialize a Unity 2D URP project.
- Set up Git and a proper .gitignore file.
- Create a GitHub repository and push the project.
- Follow Git best practices with clear commit messages

<br>

### Task 2: Isometric Player Movement & Input System

**Goal**: Implement isometric movement using Unity’s New Input System.

- Set up player movement using WASD or arrow keys.
- Use a dynamic Rigidbody2D component.
- Implement isometric camera view and smooth following.
- Ensure a configurable max speed & acceleration.

 <br>

### Task 3: AI State Machine for Enemy Behavior

**Goal**: Implement an AI system using a state machine for enemy behavior.

- Create Idle, Patrol, Chase, and Attack states.
- Detect player position and switch states dynamically.
- Use colliders or raycasts for detection.
- Implement patrolling AI with dynamic patrol routes.

 <br>

### Task 4: (To Be Chosen)

**Goal**: (Will be chosen later based on specialization)
